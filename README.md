---

AiRSpace is a server application written in Java designed to support the Runescape 317 Client protocol.

# Ambitions

- Create a intuitive, tidy and stable framework for developing runescape private servers.
- Make is easy for server hosts to customise their own server with little to no knowledge of Java.

(later)

- Support multiple version of the Runescape Client (317, 508 etc).
